    <h1>Crypto and the Shifting Landscape</h1>

    <p>
      My views on crypto, particularly Bitcoin, continue to evolve. While I’ve always had a healthy skepticism of hype-driven markets, it's hard to ignore the broader structural forces reshaping our financial future. The long arc of monetary history—marked by currency debasement, fiscal dominance, and diminishing trust in traditional institutions—sets the stage for decentralized alternatives to gain traction.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the last decade, Bitcoin has transformed from a fringe experiment into what some view as digital gold. Ethereum, Solana, and others offer infrastructure for a programmable financial future. These are no longer merely speculative plays—they reflect a growing belief in systems designed to be transparent, permissionless, and borderless.
    </p>

    <p>
      That belief is powerful. As Raoul Pal often points out, networks thrive on belief. The more people who see value in digital assets, the stronger and more resilient the system becomes. This isn’t just theory—network effects are observable in price action, developer engagement, institutional adoption, and public discourse.
    </p>

    <p>
      I follow a range of thinkers who offer insight beyond hype: <strong>Raoul Pal</strong> and <strong>Julien Bittel</strong> at Real Vision, <strong>Andreas Steno</strong and his macro-crypto crosswinds, <strong>Jordi Visser</strong on regime shifts, and of course <strong>Michael Saylor</strong, who has staked his thesis—and balance sheet—on Bitcoin as a treasury reserve.
    </p>

    <p>
      The current U.S. administration appears increasingly open to regulated digital asset frameworks, potentially paving the way for broader acceptance. While I do not align blindly with any political platform, I note this trend as part of the broader narrative that supports crypto’s legitimacy.
    </p>

      “The future is already here — it's just not evenly distributed.”

    <p>
      Bitcoin may not replace the dollar tomorrow. But as trust in fiat currencies erodes and systems become more digitally native, the probability of crypto assets playing a foundational role in our economic architecture continues to increase.
