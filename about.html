        <h3><em>Some words about AG O'Donnell</em></h3>
        <p>
        Hi there! I was born in a small town in the United States and have spent most of my life in Texas and Colorado. I’ve also spent a great deal of time in Mexico, both as a child and as an adult. 
        I attended the University of Texas at Austin.
        </p>

        <h3><em>Some more about my path</em></h3>
        <p>
        I originally pursued a career in Finance, back when the Texas business school carried the name of Dr. Kozmetsky. 
        Over time, I worked with private equity firms, wire houses, and investment banks. 
        My focus was helping clients fund their entry into new markets—work that required identifying performance indicators and modeling expected outcomes. 
        That evolved into designing metrics to evaluate competing strategies.
        </p>

        <h3><em>A change in direction</em></h3>
        <p>
        As time went on, data became a central focus. I pursued new technical skills and earned a Master of Science in Data Science from Northwestern University. 
        </p>
        <p>
        A lot of success in data comes from knowing how to frame a problem. Programming is equally important—but challenging. 
        It’s not just about learning a language; it’s about structuring ideas so that computers can execute them reliably.
        </p>

        <h3><em>A fun reality</em></h3>
        <p>
        That pursuit of clarity and structure has led me to work with both startups and large enterprises—each with unique challenges and datasets. 
        I’ve built systems that connect, prepare, and analyze data streams—using APIs, cloud-based algorithms, and multi-stage storage pipelines.
        </p>
        <p>
        Each project demands thoughtful planning, continuous learning, and precise execution.
        </p>

        <div class="quote">
          “This is not a story about big data, or even about big investments in data. 
          This is a story about a lot of little data. 
          More important, it’s about betting your business success on the ability of good people to use good data to make good decisions.”
