        <h3><em>Some words about A.G. O'Donnell</em></h3>
        <p>
        Hi there! I was born in a small town in the United States and have spent most of my life in Texas. I’ve also spent a great deal of time in Mexico, both as a child and an adult. 
        I was fortunate to be admitted to the University of Texas at Austin—and I genuinely believe in its motto.
        </p>

        <h3><em>Some more about my path</em></h3>
        <p>
        I originally pursued a career in Finance, back when the business school still carried the name of Dr. Kozmetsky. Over time, I worked with private equity firms, wire houses, and investment banks. 
        My focus became helping clients finance their entry into new markets—a process that required identifying the right performance indicators and modeling expectations. 
        This evolved into creating metrics to evaluate the likelihood of success across competing strategies.
        </p>

        <h3><em>A change in direction</em></h3>
        <p>
        Over time, data became my central obsession. Pursuing it led me to develop a new set of technical skills. As part of that journey, I enrolled in Northwestern University’s Master of Science program in Predictive Analytics, where I absorbed a great deal from their curriculum.
        </p>
        <p>
        A lot of success in data comes from learning how to frame a problem. Programming, too, is essential—but difficult. It takes time to develop fluency, perhaps the “10,000 hours” Malcolm Gladwell famously describes. 
        What I’ve found is that it’s not just about learning a language—it’s about shaping clear ideas and translating them into logic that computers can follow.
        </p>

        <h3><em>A fun reality</em></h3>
        <p>
        That pursuit of clarity and structure has led to collaborations with both small startups and large enterprises—each working with data at their own scale. 
        I’ve built systems that link, prepare, and analyze data streams—leveraging APIs, cloud algorithms, and multi-stage storage pipelines.
        </p>
        <p>
        Each project demands a thoughtful plan, fresh learning, and solid execution.
        </p>

        <div class="quote">
        “Companies don’t magically develop those competencies just because they’ve invested in high-end analytics tools. 
        They first need to learn how to use the data already embedded in their core operating systems, 
        much the way people must master arithmetic before they tackle algebra. 
        Until a company learns how to use data and analysis to support its operating decisions, 
        it will not be in a position to benefit from data.”

        <div class="quote">
        “This is not a story about big data, or even about big investments in data. 
        This is a story about a lot of little data. 
        More important, it’s about betting your business success on the ability of good people to use good data to make good decisions.”
