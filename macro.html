    <h1>Macro</h1>

    <p>
      I’m a believer in macro investing — the idea that the largest forces in the global economy
      tend to shape the overall direction of asset prices. Whether it’s monetary policy,
      demographic shifts, geopolitical transitions, or innovation cycles, the “tide” of macro
      movements influences nearly everything underneath it.
    </p>

    <p>
      As the saying goes, <strong>"A rising tide lifts all boats."</strong> This quote, often attributed to John F. Kennedy,
      perfectly captures the dynamic where broad-based economic expansions can propel entire
      sectors, while contractions or dislocations can have the opposite effect. While nothing is
      certain in markets, some themes repeat with such frequency and structure that it becomes
      possible to assign a high probability to outcomes — especially when those outcomes align
      with structural trends.
    </p>

    <p>
      Investors like <strong>Stan Druckenmiller</strong> and <strong>George Soros</strong> are noted for their conviction in
      macro themes and their willingness to bet heavily when the probabilities align. From the
      Plaza Accord to the dot-com boom, the global financial crisis to recent monetary
      distortions, macro shifts have consistently created opportunity — and risk — on a grand scale.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “It’s not whether you’re right or wrong that’s important, but how much money you make when
      you’re right and how much you lose when you’re wrong.” — George Soros
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      This page will evolve to explore current macroeconomic signals, historical parallels, and
      frameworks for thinking probabilistically about regime changes. Investing is never certain,
      but the odds are rarely equal.
